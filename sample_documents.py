        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
        It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming
        paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard
        library and an active community that contributes thousands of third-party packages.

        FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. It's built on top of Starlette
        and Pydantic, providing automatic API documentation, type validation, and async support. FastAPI is
        one of the fastest Python frameworks available, comparable to Node.js and Go. It's perfect for

        Search engines use sophisticated algorithms to find and rank relevant documents. The core concepts
        include inverted indexes, which map words to documents, and ranking algorithms like TF-IDF and BM25.
        TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) measures how important a word is to a document
        in a collection. Modern search engines also use machine learning and vector embeddings for semantic
        search capabilities.
